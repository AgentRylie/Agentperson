- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AgentRylie
- I don't currently use the normal github for things, unless I need to.
- I use github gists, which you can access here - https://gist.github.com/AgentRylie (This has all of the OLD Versions of my IGM games or any IGM games I needed to fix for archive purposes)
- If you're more interested in the current versions, go here - https://pastebin.com/u/Agentperson (This has all of the LIVE Versions of my IGM games)

- ðŸ“« If you got here, you should already have contact to me. Otherwise, do so here.

Agentperson/Agentperson is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
